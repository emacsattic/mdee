    <h4>Mozilla Development Environment for Emacs (MDEE)</h4>

<!--BEGIN ARTICLE BODY-->
<p>
    For the last few weeks I have been hard at work trying to get a working copy
    of <a href="http://www.peerfear.org/newsmonster">NewsMonster</a> (another
    Mozilla project I am working on) ready to be used by the masses.  This means
    that <b>all</b> of the issues reported by users are going to need to be
    resolved which means I need solid Mozilla integration.

</p>

<p>
    The only problem is that I am spoiled by the excellent IDE support within
    Emacs for Java thanks to the JDEE <a
    href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">project</a> .  There really isn't a lot of
    support within Emacs for Mozilla technologies (Javascript, XPCOM, XUL, etc).

</p>

<p>
    To that end I have started to work on integration within Emacs for Mozilla.  I
    think I have made fairly good progress.
</p>

<p>
    Here is where we are:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Full and seamless support for running and evaluating javascript from within
        Emacs.
    </li>

    <li>
        XPCOM support including the creating and use of components. (WORKING) 
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to use the javascript debugger. (WORKING for introspection)
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to use network IO (There is currently a <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56398">bug</a>  for this in Bugzilla.
        Help would be appreciated!)
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to set breakpoints from within the editor and have them visible to the
        user with the new display capabilities available in Emacs 21.  We should also
        potentially add support for lisp breakpoints if this is possible.
    </li>

    <li>
        Full semantic bovinator support for javascript files.  (We need a bnf file for
        javascript support.  I am REALLY hoping someone can help out here).
    </li>

    <li>
        Distribution of javascript-mode.el for users who don't have this available. (WORKING)
    </li>

    <li>
        Chrome editing support with completion of chrome:// URLs with transparent
        update of .jar files in the chrome dir.
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to run standalone within a UNIX console and still function correctly
        with all the MDEE commands we need. (EASY)
    </li>

    <li>
        Full object browser support (and within ECB) of the the current scope and any
        object properties. (TESTING)
    </li>

    <li>
        Full ECB integration (This requires some change to the ECB that I am going to
        make in the near future)
    </li>

    <li>
        XEmacs and OSX support (OSX might be a problem because xpcshell creates a
        window and doesn't use stdin and stdout.  We will need to get this fixed.)
    </li>

    <li>
        Full introspection support including the ability to <i>"pretty print"</i> a variable
        and all its properties. (WORKING)
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to display the scope (WORKING) 
    </li>

    <li>
        IDL docindex support so that users can resolve (with completion) symbols such
        as <i>"nsIRequest"</i> and have these map to the file automatically. (WORKING)
    </li>

    <li>
        comint mode support for a xpcshell console (WORKING)
    </li>

    <li>
        Ability to fully init Mozilla from XPCOM and play with the XUL environment. (I
        have no idea if this is even possible but it would be cool!)
    </li>

</ul>
